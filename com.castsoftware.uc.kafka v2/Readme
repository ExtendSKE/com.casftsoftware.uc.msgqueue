Apache Kafka Extension- com.castsoftware.uc.kafka

Steps Followed:

1.Parse the source code and identify instances of Producers, Consumers and the Queues and create objects of them.
 
2.Create links between Producers and Consumers based on the Queue through which they are connected with.
 
3.For resolving the queue name if it is declared as a variable then resolve it within the method. If not present within the method then search for class variables.

Handled Conditions:

Producer	  Topic	  Consumer	   Satisfied?
1	           1	        1	          Yes
1	          Many	      1 	         Yes
Many	        1	        1	          Yes
1	          Many	     Many	        Yes
Many	        1	       Many	        Yes
1	           1	       Many	        Yes
Many	       Many	      1	          Yes
Many	       Many	     Many	        Yes

Limitations:

1.String resolution for the Queue name happens only when present within the method or as a class variable.Else an object is created for the variable.
